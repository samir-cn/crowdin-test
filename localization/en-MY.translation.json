Choose the listing you intend to promote and click on the “Promote” icon\n● Follow the onscreen instructions, and set your priority, daily budget, and campaign length.\n● Review the number of estimated appearances that your audience will be shown a day, and click on “next”\n● Keep an eye on how your Promoted Listing is doing on the performance page\n● Track the impressions and progress of your Promoted listings campaign through promoted listing performance report.",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.2.question": "What does “Priority” mean? ",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.2.answer": "Priority determines how likely your campaign will be successful, as well as how high your Promoted Listing is shown in the search results – the higher your priority, the more likely that your Promoted Listing appears near the top of the page, above other Promoted Listings running in the same category. This therefore could help to increase the views and speed of transactions. Priority will also determine how much you pay per 1,000 appearances in search.",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.3.question": "What does setting a “daily budget” do? ",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.3.answer": "As Promoted Listings is a pay-as-you-go tool, the number of Prime Credits that is required is quoted per 1000 appearances.\n\nThe daily budget helps you control your costs - as it lets you set the maximum number of Prime Credits that you can pay a day.\n\nThis affects the number of appearances that your listing gets a day.",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.4.question": "How will I be charged for Promoted Listings?",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.4.answer": "You will be charged based on the priority you set, as well as the number of appearances that your listing has gotten.\n\nFor example:\n\nYou set your priority to “high”, and are quoted 2 Prime Credits per 1000 appearances.\n\nYou set your daily budget to 1 Prime Credit a day.\n\nTherefore your listing will see a maximum of 500 appearances in a day.\n\nOn day 1, your listing sees 500 appearances. As such, you will be charged 1 Prime Credit for the day.\n\nOn day 2, your listing sees 250 appearances. As such, you will only be charged 0.5 Prime Credits for the day.\n\nYou are only charged for the appearances that your Promoted Listing gets.",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.5.question": "Can I view the performance report immediately?",
  "promote_listing.faq.general.5.answer": "You can view your performance report at any time on Agentnet, however, the report has a 2-hour delay for appearances in search data and a 2-day delay in listing views & leads data. As such, you will be able to view your campaign performance 2 hours after the start of the Promoted Listing.
